# Who am I and what this page is about?
This is my first jekyll project. I'd like to try it out. Welcome to give me any feedback!

## First, why I want to have a jekyell blog?
Well, it seems very pretty. And it loads faster as well.

### Difficulties
I have no experience in coding. Setting up a jekyll website seems challenging. 

# Practice makes perfect
I want to try [download][dl] function. Should I just write like this? 
[dl]:www.amazon.co.uk/404
This is amazing!
What if I want to link to some webpage? I need to do[this][], which is pretty easy [right?][]
[this]: /404/404
[right?]: www.google.com

The best way to get a feel for Markdown's formatting syntax is simply

How about <this><>?
<this>: http://www.google.com

Let me check! Can't wait to see it. It is soooo much fun!
